 // An excerpt from the "Enemycontroller.cs" for Pencil Pusher.
 // Pencil Pusher is a game about fighting pencils. the are simple, 2D characters, shaped as a stick with rounded edges. 
 //   They particularly behave as weeble wabbles, due to their low center of mass.
 //
 // Functions: Take stimuli, Decide, and Act
 // Carried out in order during Update
 // Take Stimuli records data about the player. Decide runs a series of tests to determine the best course of action, 
 //   and updates the state of mind. Act puts the object into motion, based on the state of mind, using physics.
